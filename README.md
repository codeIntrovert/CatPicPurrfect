# Deprecated Repository 🚫

## About the Project 🐱❤️

This repository was once home to a beloved Twitter bot project that brought joy and smiles to many cat enthusiasts and animal lovers. The bot, powered by the Tweepy Python library and hosted on Heroku, tirelessly posted funny and heartwarming cat pictures around the clock. Its mission extended beyond humor; it aimed to foster a happy and supportive community of cat owners while also contributing to a noble cause. 🐾

## Bot's Mission 🏥

The bot operated under the Twitter handle [https://twitter.com/HasanCatto](https://twitter.com/HasanCatto), where it shared adorable cat images and anecdotes daily. However, its significance extended beyond the realm of entertainment. It served as a means to raise funds for those pet owners facing financial challenges when their furry friends needed urgent medical attention. 💰

## The Journey 🌟

Throughout its journey, this bot garnered a dedicated following of cat lovers, who appreciated the daily dose of feline charm and the underlying mission to assist those in need. The community that formed around the bot was a testament to the positive impact it had on people's lives. 🤝

## Reason for Abandonment 💔

As much as we cherished the project and the connections it fostered, we regret to inform you that it has been abandoned. This decision was influenced by significant changes in Twitter's policies, making it increasingly challenging to operate automated bots effectively. Additionally, Heroku's removal of the free service criteria posed financial constraints that made it unsustainable to continue hosting the bot. 📉

## A Fond Farewell 🌈

To our loyal followers and supporters, we extend our heartfelt thanks for being a part of this remarkable journey. The bot may no longer grace your timelines with cat pictures, but we hope it left a lasting impression and brought smiles to your day. 

While this chapter has closed, the memories and the sense of community will forever remain. If you wish to reminisce or have any questions, please feel free to reach out. 💌

Thank you for your unwavering support and love for all things feline. 🐱❤️
